# Reversi
A game based on the game Othello, completed as homework for CS211 at Northwestern University

## Objective
Fill up the board with as much of your color as possible.

## Rules 
  1) Click to place a piece. Hover piece over a potential move to see all possible gains (indicated in red). If a piece cannot be placed in a certain square,
     there will be no highlighting.
  2) First four moves must start at the center of the board
  3) Capture opponents' pieces by sandwiching a sequence of opposite colored pieces with your piece.
  4) Capturing can occur horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
  5) Once the entire board is filled, the game is over. The player with the most pieces on the board wins (ties are possible).
